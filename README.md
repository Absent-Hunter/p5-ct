## Table Contents

### Tools

Miscellaneous utilities.

By entering a value in the level field, you can get the _minimal required experience_ to reach that level for a given persona or party member.

#### Name Changer

Using this tool, you can change the Hero's first and last name, as well as your group name.

This tool limits you to the available characters for names in the English release of the game as the game might crash when using an invalid character.

__WARNING:__ Locking a persona and then unlocking it would reset all persona stats.

### Party Stats

* _Ailments:_ Various ailment flags.
* _Level, EXP_:
  * Only relevant to the Hero.
  * Use the _Experience Calculator_ in the _Tools_ section to get correct values for these entries.
  * Editing the level is not recommended, instead edit the EXP, then enter and win a battle to initiate the game's level-up process.
  * **Party member's level and EXP are tied to their persona's level and EXP**.
